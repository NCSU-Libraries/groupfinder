groupfinder
===========

GroupFinder is a system designed to notify groups of meeting places in real time. Fill out a simple web form, and your meeting information is available on the project's home page. A large read only display, suitable for electronic signage, is also included.  GroupFinder uses a MySQL database, php for logic, and jQuery/jQuery UI for display. It was built to help ad-hoc and planned student study groups meet up in large buildings where cell phone reception can be challenging.
